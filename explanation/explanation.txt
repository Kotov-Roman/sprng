1."spring.factories" file in needed to register candidates for autoconfiguration,
otherwise beans from classes marked with @AutoConfiguration will not be used


2. @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
is needed to skip embedded db initialization, because it happens earlier
than InMemDataSourceConfig provides DataSource bean ( and this bean is not created cuz of condition)

3. @AutoConfiguration is used cuz then
@AutoConfigureOrder(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE) starts working
and beans definitions order can be managed, so bean with "fileDB" will be defined first if matches condition,
and second bean for "memDb" will not be stored in BeansFactory
